# What happened to java licence after JDK 11 ?

Simply,
  - Oracle’s JDK (commercial) – you can use this in development and testing for free, but if you use it in production you have to pay for it
  - Oracle’s OpenJDK (open source) – you can use this for free in any environment, like any open source library

That's it. You don't need to know anything else.

Starting with Java 11, Oracle will provide JDK releases under the open source GNU General Public License v2, with the Classpath Exception (GPLv2+CPE), and this is the Open JDK.From Java 11 thi will be identical to the Oracle JDK with the exception of few cosmetic and packaging differences.
